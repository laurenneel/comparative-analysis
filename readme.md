# Debugging Notes

- step into
    - Allows you to dive into the internal workings of a given function
- step over
    - Allow you to execute the line and go to the next line (all the code gets ran)
- then green "continue" button
    - will jump to the next breakpoints
    - Click the "gutter" to add a breakpoint (red dot)
- step out 
    - Jumps out of a function if you step into it
    
# Git & GitHub

Terminology:

- Git = the version control program
- Github = the site where you store the versioned/saved code
- Commit = saving your file(s) at a specific instance in time
- Changes = things that you've changed
- Staged Changed = things you're about to commit (you must stage things before committing)

1) Initializing a new git repo for a _new_ project (ran once for each new project that you create)
```
git init # initializes an empty git repo on your hard drive
```

2) Hook up repository to Github account
```
Get the SSH URL from the repository (repo) - git@github.com:laurenneel/comparative-analysis.git
git remote add origin git@github.com:laurenneel/comparative-analysis.git

```

3) Make sure we update the `requirements.txt` file when you add dependencies
`pip freeze > requirements.txt` with the virtual environment activated

# Setting Up The Environment

We want to standarize which versions of Python we're running, we can do that using `pyenv`. 

1. Install Homebrew
```
xcode-select --install
xcode-select -p
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

2. Install Pyenv, a tool that allows you to specify which Python version you want to use:
```
brew update && brew doctor
brew install pyenv
export PYTHON_BUILD_HOMEBREW_OPENSSL_FORMULA=openssl@1.0
pyenv install 3.4.4
```

3. Verify version was installed 
`pyenv versions` and verify `3.4.4` is present in the list

4. Configure Bash Profile
`echo 'eval "$(pyenv init -)"' >> ~/.bash_profile`

5. Set the Python version globally on the system
`pyenv global 3.4.4`

6. Download VSCode from `https://code.visualstudio.com/`

7. Install the `Jupyter` VSCode extension by searching with (⇧⌘P) and typing `Install extension`

8. Install NBConvert for debugging purposes `pip3 install nbconvert`

Now you're ready to start using VSCode and Jupyter together to debug and build notebooks easily.


# Using Virtual Environments in Jupyter Notebook and Python

> A virtual environment is an isolated working copy of Python. This means that each environment can have its own dependencies or even its own Python versions. This is useful if you need different versions of Python or packages for different projects. This also keeps things tidy when testing packages and making sure your main Python installation stays healthy.


### Create Virtual Environment with Virtualenv/venv

Let's setup a new isolated virtual environment for our Jupyter notebook to ensure we don't have library or version conflicts with our dependencies.

1. Install virtualenv dependencies (you should only have to run this once forever)
```
pip3 install virtualenv
```

2. Setup a new virtualenv and install the kernel (you would do this for every project you want to have)
```
virtualenv jupyterenv
source jupyterenv/bin/activate 
pip3 install ipykernel
```

3. Verify you're running within the virtual environment like so: `pip -V`

# Activating Virtual Environment 

```
source jupyterenv/bin/activate 
```

### Install sample dependencies inside of virtual environment

```
pip install -r reqs.txt
```
